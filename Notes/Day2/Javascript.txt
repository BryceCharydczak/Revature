JavaScript

Interpreted - no need for compiling
    - saves time on testing and developing

Loosely Typed:
    - variables have types but dont need to be declared or casted (similar to Python)

HashMapping:
var person = {name:"joe",age:25,email:"joe@gmail.com"}
Arrays:
var colors = ["blue","red","green"]


TYPE COERSION:
    - Implicitly casting of types

NaN = not a number
