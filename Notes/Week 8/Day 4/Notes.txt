Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm
Docker Swarm - great for setting up small container orchestration networks
Kubernetes - better for larger infrastructures

Service - group of containers



Docker Swarm 

    docker service - N number of the same container replications
        - 10 eureka container replications is one docker service

    docker stack - many docker services


    Queen and Worker dichotomy
        - Queen receives the important information and disseminated to the worker nodes in the swarm.
        - If a worker goes down, the other EC2's (worker or queen) will store the info of that downed worker.
            - if all workers and queen are full of EC2 instructions and another EC2 goes down
                provisions need to be made to start another EC2 as Infrastructure as a Code.
