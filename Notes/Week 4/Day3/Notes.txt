Session Management:

    Cookies:
        - name/value pairs stored in the browser
        - can only store text
        - simple to use but can be disabled by user
    Append URL:
        - not secure
        - information always visible to user
        - can't be disabled
        - don't require form submission
    Hidden Form Fields:
        - also can't be disabled
        - requires form submission for all navigation in the application
    Session Object (provided by Servlet API):
        - request.getSession(?create);
            + optional parameter "create", set to false means no session will be made if one already exists.


Null vs Undefined

Undefined = no object or values are set to the instantiated variable
Null = object is assigned to instantiated variable but the object is set to null
