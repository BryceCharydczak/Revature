RELATIONAL DATABASES

Primary Key - Unique, non null field which you can use to identify a specific record
Candidate Keys - a column in the table that could uniquely identify a record (primary key)
Composite Key - using more than one field as a key

Datatypes:
NUMBER
INTEGER
VARCHAR
LOB
DATE+TIME

Relational database mock up:

Customers
    CustomerID Integer (primary key)
    Name VarChar2(50)
    Address VarChar2(100)
Invoices
    CustomerID Integer (foreign key -> CustomerID)
    Amount Integer
    SalesRepID Integer (foreign key -> SalesRepID)
    InvoiceID Integer (primary key)
SalesReps
    SalesRepID Integer (primary key)
    Name VarChar2(50)
    Department VarChar2(25)



Referential Integrity
    - relationships remain consistent
    - can't make references to fields/ records that don't exist
    - deleting a referenced value will be reflected by the records referencing it

Domain Integrity
    - having consistent fields datatypes
    - having your data within the defined constraints/types


SQL - Structured query language
Data Definition Language - define the structure of our database entities
    - CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME(
        COLUMN_NAME DATA_TYPE,

    );

    ALTER
        - add additional columns
        - remove columns
        - add/drop constraints
Data Manipulation Language - interacting with records in a previously defined table.
    INSERT INTO TABLE(COLUMN1VALUE, COLUMN2VALUE)

Data Query Language
    SELECT [COLUMN_NAME}(*)
        FROM [TABLE_NAME]
        WHERE[CONDITION]
        ORDER BY [COLUMN_NAME]

Data Control Language
Transaction Control Language - designate specific transaction(one unit of work on a database)
    COMMIT - finalize the data and saved permanently in our database
    ROLLBACK - takes database back to previous savepoint or commit
    SAVEPOINT - sets a point to roll back to

    Transaction Properties:
        Atomicity - if part of a transaction fails, it all fails, the entire transaction fails.
        Consistency - standards nd constraints in your database are still valid after your transaction occurs
        Isolation - two transaction will not interfere with one another (concurrent transactions)
        Durability - commits are final



Aggregate Functions:
1 value output for a column
COUNT
MIN
MAX
AVG
SUM


Constraints:
UNIQUE
NOT NULL
FOREIGN KEY
CHECK
DEFAULT



JUNCTION TABLE - an intermediary table that holds pairs of foreign keys in order to represent many to many relationships

CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT(
    DPT_ID NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT PK_DEPARTMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    DPT_NAME VARCHAR2(50),
    MONTHLY_BUDGET NUMBER(5,2)
);
