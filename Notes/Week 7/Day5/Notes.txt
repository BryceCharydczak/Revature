Starting a Docker EC2


Create new folder called Docker-demo

Create new file called Dockerfile

Navigate to project root folder and right click to bring into powershell/some shell
    - mvn clean
    - mvn package
    This should make a snapshot jar
    - cd into target folder
    - java -jar <jar-name>
        This should run, which means it can successfully run in Docker
    
    put the jar in the Docker-demo folder


Next we will copy over the Docker-demo folder into an EC2 instance
    - ssh into EC2 with putty
    - pscp to copy

Inside EC2:
    sudo yum update -y
    sudo yum install -y docker 
    sudo service docker start 
    sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user 
    (then reload the cmd session to allow it to update permissions of last command)


Inside Docker-demo
    docker build -t fc-eureka .
