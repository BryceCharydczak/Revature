SOAP

Service Oriented Architecture: a way of creating software where applications are communicating in a standard way across the Internet.


REST: 
    - No impliciet documentation
    - Any data format (xml, json, etc)
    - lightweight
    - cached
    - accessed through url endpoint + httpverbs
    - http 
    - not contract based

SOAP: Simple Object Access Protocol
    - contract based
    - only uses xml data format
    - heavier protocol than REST
    - accessed through a service endpoint interface
    - not tied to any particular protocol
    - we use http but you dont have to (smtp, ftp, etc, all viable)


SOAP = converting our objects to xml and transportin them in a SOAP message
    1. Envelope(Required) - defines where a soap message begins/end
    2. Header(Optional) - defines additional attributes that are associated with the message
    3. Body(Required) - contains the xml data of the message
    4. Fault(Optional) - describes whats going on whenever we have some sort of error with our message processing
        - Only applies to http status codes in the 500's

        SOAP Message Fault:
            1. Fault Code - indicates the class of error
            2. Fault String - text describing the error
            3. Fault Actor - which node caused the error
            4. Details - application specific details about what caused the error


SOAP Header/Body != HttpRequestHeader/Body
Entirety of the SOAP message will be in the request/response body (POST)
Client != Browser
    - Prevelant in business to business communication (no browser involved)




SOAP Contract : Web Services Description Language (WSDL)
    - language agnostic xml document which defines the structure of a SOAP web service

Creating a SOAP Service:
    1. Contract first (Top Down) approach
        + WSDL is created before the java application
        + The java application is then structure around the definition provided in the WSDL
    2. Contract last (bottom up) approach
        + java application is created first and then our WSDL is generated based on the application code
