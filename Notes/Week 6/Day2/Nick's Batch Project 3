Calibur architecture deconstruction of monolith into microservices

calibur + Janus = organizational tool to keep track of batch info
calibur = handling and manipulating janus info


Hydra - team took hydra and split it into even smaller microservices




suggested changes to the Calibur work:

front end circuit breaking
could integrate other microservices
could add assessment and notes to our batch assessing
