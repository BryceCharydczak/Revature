Event Propagation:

When an event click is made on a child element, the user is essentially clicking the parent element.

Typical tree of tag element in html:
grandparent -> parent -> child


List of event listener execution:
bubbling = child -> parent -> grandparent
capturing = grandparent -> parent -> child



x.addEventListener("click", function(e){});

e =
event: click
target: tag "<a id="myLine"></a>"
current target
event phase: bubbling/capturing
