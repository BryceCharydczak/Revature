4 Pillars of OOP

Inheritence - subclasses have states and behaviors of superclass
Polymorphism - entities can take on many different forms
    - method override - just replaces original functionality of method
    - method overload - remakes method with more parameters or functionality
    - covarient type - Animal cat = new Cat();
Encapsulation - wrapping of methods and objects in order to "data hide".
Abstraction - remove certain aspects of the implemented model
    - abstract classes
    - interfaces




Ternary Operators:

<condition>?<ifTrue>:<ifFalse>;


Class execution priority:
static instance variables
instance variables
constructor
main


&& || (short circuit operators, end the conditional when able)


JVM <Java Virtual Machine>
JRE <Java Runtime Environment>
JDK = JRE + compiler <Java Development Kit>
