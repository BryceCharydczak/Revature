JVM = Java virtual machine - interprets compiled bytecode
JRE = Java runtime environment - JVM + important libraries.
JDK = Java Development kit - contains compiler



Object = most basic unit of programmability.



Variables
Methods
 - Both have static and instance components of each.




 Private = accessibility limited to only within the class
 Protected = only subclasses can access the class and its methods



 block scope - in a for loop, the "int i" variable is contained within the block scope of the loop


 Constructors = just a way to instantiate the class object and initialize the variables of the object.
