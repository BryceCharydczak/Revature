Overloaded method use:


Explicit casting = (long), (int), etc
Implicit casting = what the JVM does to optimize memory storage, casting variables automatically.


Banking assignment:
no negative balances
if someone withdraws money while having none, give them an error
persist all users to a text file
when registering they need to not be taking an already taken name


Iterable API
- Collection Framework
    - Set (contains no duplicate)
        - HashSet
            - Linked HashSet = no duplicates, maintains insertion order because it's linked.
        - SortedSet = sort all elements in natural order, alphanumerically
            - NavigableSet
                - TreeSet
    - List = enforce an order, get()/set()
        - ArrayList
        - Vector - Thread safe ArrayList, all methods are synchronized
            - Stack
        - LinkedList
    - Queue
        - LinkedList
        - PriorityQueue
        - BlockingQueue
            - PriorityBlockingQueue


Map:
    - HashMap
    - HashTable = threadsafe, all methods are synchronized
    - SortedMap
        - TreeMap




MULTITHREADING!!!!!<3

Thread - a single path of execution
daemon thread - a special thread that can run asynchronously from other threads
thread safe - each thread will interact with object without conflicting with other threads.
    - Synchronization - only one thread can use this at a time


How to create a thread:
1)  Extend the thread class.
    - also override the run() method
2)  Implements Runnable.
    - override run() method

Thread States:
New
Running
Waiting
Timed_Waiting
Terminated
